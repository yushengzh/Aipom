# Aipom
This toy project is based on the implementation of *[Monkey](https://interpreterbook.com/)*. **ANYWAY**, this project has been extended from the very origin and I named it  *Aipom*, which would be introduced as followed.  

**Aipom** is a basic interpreter for a C-class programming language  written in golang, which is also a kind of cute üêµ *Pok√©mon*.

### Log

- 2022/8/28ÔºöI successfully extend the *Lexer*. which could be used to generate lexical unit now. Extensions are as follows.
  - Postfix operators: `++`, `+=`, `--`. `-=`
  - Single-line commit
  - Besides `<` and `>`, I added general comparision operations `<=` and `>=`
  - Logical/Bitwise AND/OR: `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`
  - Pow operation: `^`
- 2022/8/29ÔºöI accomplished the basic REPL. I can generate lexical unit interactively via REPL.
- 2022/8/30ÔºöFirst step: struct *AST*
